# Integral/Derivative Calculator
 Derivative:
  This program takes an equation the user enters the terms for and estimates the derivative. The user gives it an x value to find the value of what the derivative would be for the x value. The equation can handle an amount of terms up to 10. The user enters the coefficients of the equations(it cannot parse strings), then the user gives the program an x value. It will output the estimated value of the derivative to a precision of 0.00000000005. 
  
 Integral:
  This part of the program estimates the program to fairly high precision using Simpson's 1/3 Rule or the Trapezoid Method for finding the area under a curve. Just like above, the user is able to input an equation of up to 10 terms. The user gives a lower bound and an upper bound to find the integral. The user will then input the amount of sections to use for finding the integral(limit of 10,000). It will then output a close estimation of what the integral will be. The Simpson's 1/3 rule will give a more precise answer than the Trapezoid method will.
