# Integral/Derivative Calculator
 Derivative:
  This program takes an equation the user enters the terms for and finds the derivative. The user gives it an x value to find the value of what the derivative would be for the x value. The equation can handle an amount of terms up to 10. The user enters the coefficients of the equations(it cannot parse strings), then the user gives the program an x value.
  
 Integral:
  This part of the program estimates the program to fairly high precision using Simpson's 1/3 Rule or the Trapezoid Method for finding the area under a curve.
